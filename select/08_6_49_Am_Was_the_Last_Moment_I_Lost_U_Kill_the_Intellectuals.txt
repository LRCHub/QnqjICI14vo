Bet you don't remember
What you said last night
You were so drunk
And probably high

The cops told me you were far gone
And alone
After the resonance festival

I would've saved you if I could've
I would've stopped you if I could
You said you don't remember it, but it was fun
But not for me
I woke up nearly crying from anxiety

This has become a constant
I'm supposed to be there when you're not
When you're not

This has become a constant
There are no variables
I'm always there to save you when I can

But I can't
I'm just a woman, a man
I only have two hands
I don't even try and fucking cry

Don't get drunk and call me
Don't do shrooms and miss me
Stop blowing up my phone

I fucking loved you
With all I could
I wanted it to be
All like the movies
But you left me
And you weren't even well

I didn't leave you first
Even though that's what
The general population thinks

Your eyes were so dead
You pulled away when I was sweet
Said I was sweet
What does that mean?
You keep telling me that I'm different from those other girls
That pursue you

I don't know what you see
I'm not your mommy
I want to save you
I want to help you
I want to hold you

But I can't
'Cause you slip through my fingertips
And you never stay more than a few hours before running away
