Could this be the end?
We're leaving again
Apart will be too far
Could these be the words?
Crudely absurd
Please tell us if they are

Leave the light on
We'll die wide-eyed
Leave the light
Wide-eyed we'll die
Leave the light on
We'll die wide-eyed
And believe the light stays on

We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
As our disbelief died
Dissolved into faith
We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
As our disbelief died
Dissolved into faith

This, the last
Creation of past
Mind our kind, our star
All that we are

We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
As our disbelief died
Dissolved into faith
We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
As our disbelief died
Dissolved into faith

Did they keep on telling
What we wanted to hear?
Did they keep on making
Our guilt disappear?
Did they keep on lying
Sounding so sincere?
Did they keep on trying?

Leave the light on
We'll die wide-eyed
Leave the light
Wide-eyed we'll die
Leave the light on
We'll die wide-eyed
And believe the light stays on

We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
As our disbelief died
Dissolved into faith
We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
As our disbelief died
Dissolved into faith

We wanted to listen
We wanted to wait
We wanted to listen, yeah
We wanted to wait
