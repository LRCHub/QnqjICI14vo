Life's a twisted road
We unwind together
Clouds uncover our sky
Sitting in a couch made of sand
The milky ring around the moon
Enchants me...
I'm swimming through
The tunnels of my mind./
The waves of energy
Splash over my body
Transition from day, into night
The euphoria of spinning in the
Moonlight
Open up yourself
To what is out there
But don't take off
Like a snowball down a hill
You inspire me to be so crazy
You inspire me to be free
You inspire me to be so crazy
You inspire me to be free
Life's a twisted road
We unwind together
The ubiquity of our love
Is what makes it last forever...
You've got to flow like the river
You've got to shine like the sun
You've got to flow like the river
You've got to shine, shine like the sun
Going through the sky, within my mind
And sweeping me away...
You inspire me to be so crazy
You inspire me to be free
You inspire me to be so crazy
You inspire me to be free
Tune in the sky
Ubiquitous and natural
Carry the light
Sympatico and simple
Tune in the sky
Ubiquitous and natural
Carry the light
And take it deeper and deeper inside
Take it deeper and deeper inside
Take it deeper and deepef inside
